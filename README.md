# Ranish Partition Manager

This is a fork of Ranish Partition Manager 2.37.11 developed until 1998
by Mikhail Ranish. Version 2.37.11 was the last version of the software with
source code distributed under public domain.

The public domain statement for the source code of RANISH is given in the
original README.TXT file. The README.TXT also states that the binaries are
freeware. Because they are not public domain I did not include the binaries
in the repository. I gave the original version git tag v2.37.11-original.

I plan to make some small modifications to the source code and have put it
under Creative Commons CC-0 1.0 license.

## Building
Because of the missing binary `ALT_FONT.COM` the creation of the make target
`zip` fails for the original version. I am not sure for what `ALT_FONT.COM`
is good, but it seams to have something to do with the russian version.

## Change Log

### Version 2.37.99
 * Relicense under Creative Commons CC-0 license
 * Recompile with Borland C++ 3.1
 * Remove old links and point to new repository
